## Preface
IIBA was founded in Toronto October 2003, but BABOK release 1.0 showed up January 2005. More versions were created. The Business Analysis Core Concet Model (BACCM) was added. I appreciate the following: "The BABOK® Guide should not be construed to mandate that the practices described in this publication should be followed under all circumstances. Any set of practices must be tailored to the specific conditions under which business analysis is being performed."

## 1. Introduction
**1.1 Purpose of the Guide**<br>
&emsp;"It helps practitioners discuss and define the skills necessary to effectively perform business analysis work... The six knowledge areas of the BABOK® Guide (Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring, Elicitation and Collaboration, Requirements Life Cycle Management, Strategy Analysis, Requirements Analysis and Design Definition (RADD), and Solution Evaluation) describe the practice of business analysis."

**1.2 What is Business Analysis**<br>
&emsp;"Business analysis is the practice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders... It can be used to understand the current state, to define the future state, and to determine the activities required to move from the current to the future state... The BABOK® Guide describes several of these perspectives: agile, business intelligence, information technology, business architecture, and business process management."

**1.3 Who is a Business Analyst?**<br>
&emsp;"Business analysts are responsible for discovering, synthesizing, and analyzing information from a variety of sources within an enterprise, including tools, processes, documentation, and stakeholders. The business analyst is responsible for eliciting the actual needs of stakeholders—which frequently involves investigating and clarifying their expressed desires—in order to determine underlying issues and causes."
