## How to Set Priorities

#### ...When Everything Feels Urgent
**(Without feeling guilty for saying no)**<br>
-Andrea Patrone

| Step | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Don’t start with your tasks,<br>start with your outcomes | <small>- Ask: “What does success actually look like this week?”<br>- When you’re clear on results, you can drop what doesn’t serve them.<br>- Busyness ≠ Progress.</small> |
| Use the ‘Impact vs. Effort’ filter | <small>- Not all tasks are equal.<br>→ High impact / low effort = do first<br>→ High impact / high effort = plan and schedule<br>→ Low impact = question if it’s worth doing at all</small> |
| Prioritize people, not just projects | <small>- Some of your most important work is invisible:<br>→ Building trust<br>→ Unblocking teammates<br>→ Clarifying direction</small> |
| Choose 3 priorities per day | <small>- The brain isn’t built for 10 urgent tasks.<br>- Choose 3 things that matter most.</small> |
| Say “not now” without guilt | <small>- You protect priorities by protecting your focus.<br>You don’t have to say “no” forever—just not now.<br>→ “Happy to explore this—can we revisit next week?”<br>→ “This deserves full attention, but I’m focused elsewhere today.”</small> |
| Share your focus with your team | <small>You can’t lead with clarity if you prioritize in silence.<br>Tell your team what you’re working on—and why. This creates:<br>✓ Alignment<br>✓ Accountability<br>✓ Fewer interruptions</small> |
| Check in weekly—what’s noise vs what matters? | <small>- Over time, you’ll learn to spot true priorities faster.<br>- Each week, ask:<br>→ What’s the most valuable thing I did?<br>→ What could I drop with no real consequence?</small> |
