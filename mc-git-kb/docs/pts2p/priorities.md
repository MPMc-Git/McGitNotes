## How to Set Priorities

#### ...When Everything Feels Urgent
**(Without feeling guilty for saying no)**<br>
-Andrea Patrone

1. Don’t start with your tasks, start with your outcomes
    - <small>Ask: “What does success actually look like this week?”
    - When you’re clear on results, you can
drop what doesn’t serve them.
    - Busyness ≠ Progress.</small>

1. Use the ‘Impact vs. Effort’ filter
    - Not all tasks are equal.
Plot your work into 4 categories:
    - → High impact / low effort = do first
    - → High impact / high effort = plan and
schedule
    - → Low impact = question if it’s worth
doing at all

1. Prioritize people, not just projects
    - Some of your most important work is
invisible:
    - → Building trust
    - → Unblocking teammates
    - → Clarifying direction
    - Your calendar should reflect this—not
just deliverables.

1. Choose 3 priorities per day. Max
    - The brain isn’t built for 10 urgent tasks.
    - Choose 3 things that matter most.
    - Everything else?
    - Bonus—not baseline.

1. Say “not now” without guilt
    - You don’t have to say “no” forever—just
not now.
    - Try:
        - → “Happy to explore this—can we revisit
next week?”
        - → “This deserves full attention, but I’m focused elsewhere today.”
    - You protect priorities by protecting your focus.

1. Share your focus with your team
    - Tell your team what you’re working on—
and why.
    - This creates:
        - ✓ Alignment
        - ✓ Accountability
        - ✓ Fewer interruptions
    - You can’t lead with clarity if you
prioritize in silence.

1. Check in weekly—what’s noise vs what
matters?
    - Each week, ask:
        - → What’s the most valuable thing I did?
        - → What could I drop with no real
consequence?
    - Over time, you’ll learn to spot true
priorities faster.
