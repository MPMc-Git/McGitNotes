Continuing my daily study. I’m sharing one key takeaway each day to process these ideas and invite discussion. I'll also try to summarize each month's worth of material. This is definitely not meant as a replacement for the actual material, just me having a specific location as a reminder of the things I have learned and maybe I'll be able to update based on my own personal growth.

  <td><span class="sm-text">Internal Realism</span><br><span class="xs-text">Hilary Putnam moved from strict realism to “internal realism,” observing that how we describe reality depends on our conceptual schemes.</span></td>
  <td><span class="sm-text">Functionalism</span><br><span class="xs-text">Putnam’s functionalism redefined mind-body discussions by focusing on what mental states do. If a system processes inputs (like sense data) and outputs (like behaviors) in ways that mirror, say, pain or belief, it counts as having that mental state.</span></td>
  <td><span class="sm-text">Universal Grammar</span><br><span class="xs-text">Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and cognitive scientist, revolutionized language studies by suggesting children have an inborn “universal grammar.” While each language differs in specifics, Chomsky believed they share deep structural rules that the child’s mind expects.</span></td>
  <td><span class="sm-text">Political Activism</span><br><span class="xs-text">Noam Chomsky condemned how governments and elites manipulate information to maintain control. His broader theme: “Manufacturing consent” isn’t always done via brute censorship; it’s often subtle. Media rely on official sources, choosing frames that cast authority in a good light or demonize opponents.</span></td>
  <td><span class="sm-text">Manufacturing Consent</span><br><span class="xs-text">Chomsky, alongside Edward Herman, wrote Manufacturing Consent, detailing how mass media in free societies often serve elite agendas. Not by explicit censorship, but through subtle filters: corporate ownership, advertising pressure, reliance on official sources, and the marginalizing of critical voices.</span></td>
