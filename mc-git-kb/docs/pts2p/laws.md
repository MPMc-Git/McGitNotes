## 5 Brutal Laws
**#NatanMohart**

1. **Murphy's Law**
  <br>*"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong"*
  <br>No matter how perfect your plan looks, if it can break it will break
  <br>Anticipate failure. Build safety nets. Test twice.
1. **Wilson's Law**
  <br>*"If you prioritize everything, you prioritize nothing"*
  <br>Busy != Productive
  <br>The ability to say "no" is a superpower. Ruthless focus wins.
1. **Gilbert's Law**
  <br>*"The biggest problem at work is that nobody tells you what to do"*
  <br>In reality, most rules are ambiguous
  <br>Don't wait for instructions. Create clarity. Own the mission.
1. **Falkland's Law**
  <br>*"If it isn't necessary to decide, it is necessary not to decide"*
  <br>Not all decisions are urgent
  <br>Delay what you can. Time brings insight. Most things resolve themselves.
1. **Kidlin's Law**
  <br>*"If you can write the problem down clearly, you're halfway to solving it"*
  <br>Clarity reduces anxiety
  <br>If it lives in your head, it controls you. Write it down, and you control it.
