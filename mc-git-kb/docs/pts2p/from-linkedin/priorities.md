#### How to Set Priorities When Everything Feels Urgent
###### (Without feeling guilty for saying no)
-Andrea Patrone<p>

1. Don’t start with your tasks, start with your outcomes
   - Ask: “What does success actually look like this week?”
   - When you’re clear on results, you can
drop what doesn’t serve them.
   - Busyness ≠ Progress.

1. Use the ‘Impact vs. Effort’ filter
   - Not all tasks are equal.
Plot your work into 4 categories:
   - → High impact / low effort = do first
   - → High impact / high effort = plan and
schedule
   - → Low impact = question if it’s worth
doing at all

1. Prioritize people, not just projects
   - Some of your most important work is
invisible:
   - → Building trust
   - → Unblocking teammates
   - → Clarifying direction
   - Your calendar should reflect this—not
just deliverables.

1. Choose 3 priorities per day. Max
   - The brain isn’t built for 10 urgent tasks.
   - Choose 3 things that matter most.
   - Everything else?
   - Bonus—not baseline.

1. Say “not now” without guilt
   - You don’t have to say “no” forever—just
not now.
   - Try:
     - → “Happy to explore this—can we revisit
next week?”
     - → “This deserves full attention, but I’m focused elsewhere today.”
   - You protect priorities by protecting your focus.

1. Share your focus with your team
   - Tell your team what you’re working on—
and why.
   - This creates:
     - ✓ Alignment
     - ✓ Accountability
     - ✓ Fewer interruptions
   - You can’t lead with clarity if you
prioritize in silence.

1. Check in weekly—what’s noise vs what
matters?
   - Each week, ask:
     - → What’s the most valuable thing I did?
     - → What could I drop with no real
consequence?
   - Over time, you’ll learn to spot true
priorities faster.
