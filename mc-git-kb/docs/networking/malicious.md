Malicious code comes in many forms and constantly changes as previous attack routes are closed and
new ones are found. The most common types of malicious code found today are:<br>
• Backdoor – a program that allows unauthorized access at will to an attacker<br>
• Keylogger – code that records keystrokes entered by the user<br>
• Logic bomb – malicious code that has been set to run at a specified date and time or when certain
conditions are met<br>
• Ransomware - malicious software that infects your computer and displays messages
demanding a fee to be paid for your system to work again<br>
• Rootkit – a program used to disguise malicious activities on a computer by hiding the processes
and files from the user<br>
• Trojan – a program that pretends to be legitimate code but conceals other unwanted functions.
Often disguised as a game or helpful utility program<br>
• Virus – a program that performs an unwanted function on the infected computer. This could
involve destructive actions or the collection of information that the attacker can use<br>
• Worm – a program that is capable of copying itself onto other computers or devices without user
interaction
